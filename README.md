## PROJECT OVERVIEW 

  The project titled "Attendance Tracker with Facial Recognition using QR Code" presents an 
innovative solution aimed at revolutionizing attendance management in educational institutions. 
Initially, the project involved developing a mobile application for Android that serves as an advanced 
attendance tracking system. It enabled students to scan QR codes, capture their facial images for 
verification, and securely send attendance data to a server. Additionally, a web interface was designed 
for staff to access attendance records, enhancing management efficiency. 


## INITIAL PROJECT ACHIEVEMENTS: 
  The initial phase of the project successfully addressed several challenges in traditional attendance tracking methods. 
By integrating QR code scanning and facial recognition, the system ensured 
accurate attendance recording, reduced manual processes, and enhanced data security. Students could 
easily log in, scan QR codes, and capture facial images, while staff benefited from streamlined data 
retrieval and reporting features.

## Enhancements: 
### The project has undergone several enhancements to further elevate its effectiveness:
#### 1.	Enhanced Facial Recognition Algorithm:
##### The facial recognition algorithm has been optimized to improve accuracy and reduce processing time significantly. Advanced techniques, including deep learning and model optimization, have been employed to enhance facial recognition accuracy and speed, ensuring a seamless user experience.

#### 2.	Improved User Interface:
##### Both the mobile application and web interface have undergone significant improvements in terms of user experience and design. The interface is now more intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing, enhancing user satisfaction and usability.

#### 3.	Advanced Analytics and Insights:
##### The analytics module has been enriched to provide advanced insights into attendance data.This empowers educators to take proactive measures to address attendance issues and improve student engagement and academic performance.
